# Engage

In 2020 comunities are using blockchain plattforms to gain value from its activities. In 2077 someone might exploit a glitch to take it all.

This is our #Hack20 project, we have so much fun doing it.

## Notes

### Web
Web is working with a couple of issues:
- Back button on some screens is failing, maybe a flutter_web issue.
- We are using some SVG that maybe there are not in the right place.

### iOS
Sadly, we didn't have an Apple device to develop and test, but making the necessary platform updates, most of all Firebase related, will be running without problems.
