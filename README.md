## Notes

### Credentials
`google-services.json` and `firebase.js` are uncommitted for security reasons.

### Web
Web is working with a couple of issues:
- Back button on some screens is failing, maybe a flutter_web issue.

### iOS
Sadly, we didn't have an Apple device to develop and test, but making the necessary platform updates, most of all Firebase related, will be running without problems, sorry.
